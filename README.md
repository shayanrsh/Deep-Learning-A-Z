![](https://github.com/shayanrsh/Deep-Learning-A-Z/blob/main/Deep_Learning_ReadME.gif)

This repo contains my code and work for the [Deep Learning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) on Udemy. The course covers various topics and applications of deep learning, such as artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

## What I learned üß†
- How to build and train different types of neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras
- How to use deep learning for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, sentiment analysis, text generation, etc.
- How to optimize and fine-tune deep learning models using techniques such as regularization, dropout, batch normalization, etc.
- How to use transfer learning and pre-trained models to leverage existing knowledge and improve performance
- How to deploy and share deep learning models using tools such as Google Colab, GitHub, and TensorFlow Lite
## What I achieved üèÜ
- I completed all the lectures, quizzes, and assignments in the course with a score of 95%
- I implemented several deep learning projects using real-world datasets and challenges, such as:
- A face recognition system that can identify celebrities from images
- A text summarizer that can generate concise summaries from news articles
- A music generator that can compose original melodies using LSTM networks
- A style transfer application that can apply artistic effects to images
- A chatbot that can have a natural conversation with users
